Create a frontend for this project, it should look clean as its for law firms, I want it to have a good, catchy name, for example Temis, greek godess of the justice. It should look professional, I'm thinking of white and gray shades. feel free to ask any   questions. It should have a simple landing page, with a sign up and a login button, both should do nothing for now, we'll worry about it later. When the user click login it should go to the "main" page, a chat view where the user can see the previous sessions in the left, and a big chat box in the middle. In the top of the web it should say Bienvenido, {username}. This app will have three user levels, the lowest one we will call it basic, it will have access to the chat, its previous sessions and will have a config panel where it can check its available materias, date access if its have any restriction and the remainin quota, nothing more for now. Then is the supervisor level, this level can do the same as the basic user plus edit the materias the basic user can access, filter the available dates for that user, asign,remove and edit quotas, edit,add or delete users. The permission level has to be with the most granularity possible (read,edit). And last is the admin level, the admin level can do what the other user can but it can change the user level of other users, asign and delete permissions. Feel free to add any other permission you think is important in this scenario. I dont know yet which is the best font to use in this project but Im leaning towards times new roman as it is the most "legalish" font, but if you have another option we can discuss it.

Make sure the components are reutilizable, make sure to follow the best design and architectural practices and leave every decission documented in files
